# Password_Generator

## User Storey
As a developer I was asked to create the javascript code for creating a password generatior.  With this we want to randomly generate a password that meets certain required criteria that creates a strong password.

# Key Componants

while generating the javascript code for this password generator I need to be focused on the following items:
It will ened a series of prompts
It will need to prompt for Upper case, Lower case, Numbers, and Special Characters.
It will need to only allow the password to be 8 or more characters
AFTER all criterior above is met, It will generate a password.
If some of the cirterior is not met it will display an alert to the page.
