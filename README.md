# Password_Generator

## User Storey
As a developer I was asked to create the javascript code for creating a password generatior.  With this we want to randomly generate a password that meets certain required criteria that creates a strong password.

## Key Componants

while generating the javascript code for this password generator I need to be focused on the following items:
It will ened a series of prompts
It will need to prompt for Upper case, Lower case, Numbers, and Special Characters.
It will need to only allow the password to be 8 or more characters
AFTER all criterior above is met, It will generate a password.
If some of the cirterior is not met it will display an alert to the page.

## Takeaways
I want to call out my buddy John Youngman.  He really helped talk me through some of the Logic that I was struggeling with.  We spent a few hours going over and talking though how I should think about each step.  He gave me some great things to google and help me shorten some of the very lengthy code I had originally put on the the page.  Big shout out to him.  I really struggeled with some of this.  I feel like after this is done, I feel more confident, but I spent a LOT of time on this.  in the end it is right, but I need to be able to work faster through some of these excersizes and not have to burden myself with so much time.  Im hoping the more and more i uinderstand the concepts, the lest I have to google and research and the more I can just test and debug.
